# frontend-mentor-hackathon
This is my implementation of the wheather app that is present in the frontend mentor hackathon


# A developer's journey üõ£Ô∏è
A lot of tutorials show the final version of the code and touch the bare minimum of all of the gotchas present throughout the project.  
This is not the case here!  
This repo is intended as a documentation of a one-month journey through trying to create a weather app as part of the hackathon.  

## How is it different? ü§î
1. I document the details and discuss different design decisions 
2. If I took a wrong route, I document that instead of just having the knowledge for myself üó∫Ô∏è
3. I use AI tools like chatgpt and claude, but I **don't write a single line of code that I don't fully understand**.  
After getting info from these tools, I ask them to tell me some resources to search the correctness of the info they provided, and I search within these resources to check the correctness of each piece of information. 

4. Finally, I try to follow principles from clean code, refactoring and code complete books. You will find me using principles from these books and mentioning them throught the journey

Without further saying, Let's get started!

The above introduction was a nice one though.  
Last couple of weeks, I was busy with a project for a [one month summer training provided by ministry of communications and Information Technology in Egypt](https://github.com/Mohammed-Lashein/ITI-frontend-1-month-summer-training), so I didn't have time to complete the weather app.  

Since the training ended, now I have a one week to deliver the project. I am not sure if I can make it on time, but this is an opportunity that can't be missed.
